### Objective:
Stock Markets have a turn-over of thousands of billions of dollars which make it the preferred choice for people to invest their money in. There are 15,000 stocks traded in the U.S. on a daily basis which makes the problem a voluminous one. Along with volume, the volatile nature of the stock prices can make it difficult for a layman to weigh in all the factors contributing towards the rise and fall of a stock price. 
Can big data technologies with big data help one make a better financial decision and result in big profits? The objective of this project is to help an investor make a decision supported by historical data from the stock market by predicting the closing prices of a day along with stock recommendations for financial investing. We explore two approaches, regression modeling with spark and LSTM network built with Keras to explain trends in stock prices. 

### Data:
The [dataset](https://www.quandl.com/databases/SEP/data) contains stock market data for more than 6,500 active tickers, with historical data since the year 1998. It has 7 million observations for 49 different variables. It was acquired from Quandl and was collected by an independent research firm, Sharadar.
